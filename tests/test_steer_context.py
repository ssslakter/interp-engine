"""The non-eager `steer()` context: what it records, for whom, and for how long.

On a served backend nothing is installed globally -- the spec is recorded in a `ContextVar` and each
following call passes it as a per-request steer. That is what keeps a co-batched request from being
steered by somebody else's block, so the recording rules are the correctness argument and not an
implementation detail:

- keyed on the model, so a block opened for one does not leak onto another;
- composed when nested, matching eager, where two hook sets both fire;
- gone at the end of the block, including when the body raises.

Driven against a stub rather than a real engine: what is under test is `steer()`'s bookkeeping, and a
GPU is needed only to prove the recorded spec reaches the worker
(`apps/inference/scripts/vllm_unified_sync_check.py` does that).
