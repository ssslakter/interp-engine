"""Engine-owned vLLM backend (replaces the vendored steerllm/chatspace wrapper).

interp-engine constructs and owns the vLLM engine directly, with native
residual extraction turned on (``extract_hidden_states`` + the hidden-states KV
connector). This is the foundation of removing steerllm: the engine -- not a
vendored wrapper -- owns vLLM construction, capture, (later) generation and
steering.

This first layer is the synchronous ``LLM`` capture path (residuals via native
extraction; intra-block taps + steering via the collective_rpc hooks in
``vllm_capture``). Async generation/streaming + steering write-hooks + server
wiring come next; see plan ``engine-owns-vllm``.

Requires vLLM (Linux/CUDA); imports are lazy so importing this module is safe on
macOS/CPU.

    """Async engine-owned vLLM backend (vLLM 0.25 ``AsyncLLM``) with native extraction.

    This is the server-facing variant: non-blocking generation + capture. Must be
    constructed inside a running event loop (``AsyncLLM.from_engine_args`` starts a
    background engine loop). Steering write-hooks are added separately.

    This class is all three vLLM backends :func:`~interp_engine.load_model` offers, told apart
    by their tap set. Omitting ``static_points`` is ``backend="vllm"``: hooked, every point,
    chosen per request. Passing ``"auto"`` or a list of addresses is ``backend="vllm-static"``:
    CUDA-graph replay over exactly those taps, which also forces vLLM's breakable path (replay,
    no Dynamo). Passing ``[]`` is ``backend="vllm-generate"``: graphs with inductor and no taps,
    which serves generation only. Prefer ``load_model(backend=...)`` over constructing this
    directly, and prefer ``static_points`` over setting ``enforce_eager`` yourself.

        prefill-shaped, so the decode-only kernels -- Triton attention's split-softmax path and
        ``reduce_segments``, the Triton sampler -- were left to JIT inside the first real
        request, which is a latency spike vLLM itself logs a warning about. Two tokens is the
        cheapest generation that covers both shapes: the prefill, then one decode step.

        Kernel compile failure is not fatal: the engine is up, and those kernels will compile
        on the first request. A static self-test failure **is** fatal. Declaring a tap is not
        proof ``copy_`` / ``add_`` landed in the recorded graph; a dead write is fluent
        unsteered text. When static sites exist, warmup refuses rather than serve that.

        ``capture_points`` registers activation capture on the SAME request, so the
        generation's own forwards yield ``[prompt + generated - 1, width]`` per point
        instead of a caller re-prefilling the finished text (the final sampled token is
        never processed through the model). Rows are merged into ``capture_out``, which
        is complete once the returned generator is exhausted / the call returns. When a
        steering spec is also active the hook steers before it captures, so the captured
        rows are post-intervention -- which is what makes a steered generation double as
        its own post-cap read.

        ``drain_every`` bounds how long captured rows sit in worker memory: they are
        moved to the host after the first forward (the prefill, which is the bulk) and

        Prefix caching is on engine-wide, and this is the one place that decides who opts out.
        Pass ``private_kv_for=<request id>`` for any request that reads the forward activations
        (capture, attention, native extraction) or changes them (steering, lens); leave it off
        for plain generation, which is what the caching is for.

        The mechanism is vLLM's ``cache_salt``. It goes into the ``extra_keys`` of the FIRST
        block's hash, and block hashes chain through ``parent_block_hash``, so a salt no other
        request has used makes every one of this request's block hashes unique. That isolates it
        in both directions, which is what correctness needs here: it cannot HIT a block computed
        by someone else (so a capture forwards every token, and a steered request computes its
        own steered KV rather than inheriting unsteered KV), and its blocks cannot be hit BY
        anyone else (so steered KV never gets served to a later plain request). Requests that
        pass no salt keep vLLM's ordinary hashing and go on sharing with each other.

        The request id is reused as the salt rather than minting a second token, so a cache-hit
        question can be traced back to the request that owned the blocks. Any unique string works.

        Isolation is per request, so two identical capture calls share nothing and each pays a
        full prefill. That is deliberate: making them share would mean deriving the salt from
        everything that affects the activations, including steering vectors, and a salt that is
        wrong in either direction is silent corruption. A missed cache hit only costs time.

        ``_global_intervention`` covers what a per-request salt cannot. ``set_steering`` and
        ``set_lens_intervention`` install write-hooks that apply to EVERY later request, so
        during that window even a plain generation computes intervened KV. Salting those
        requests with a token minted when the hooks went in keeps that KV from being served
        after ``clear_steering``, while still letting requests within one window share with each
        other -- they see the same hooks, so their blocks really are interchangeable.

        """Stream lens read-outs, yielding ``(first_position, top_idx, top_probs, token_ids)``.

        The fused form of :meth:`capture_generation_stream` + :meth:`decode_residuals_topk`: the
        captured rows are transported through the resident ``J_bar`` and unembedded in the worker,
        so only top-k crosses ``collective_rpc``. Driving the two separately sends the residuals
        out and straight back -- ~63 MB each way for a 96-position 64-layer read-out, which is
        where that path spent most of its time. Call :meth:`set_lens_jacobians` first; without it
        every layer reads out untransported.

        ``specs`` is one ``{"layers": [...], "jacobian": bool}`` per lens type. Each yield carries
        ``top_idx``/``top_probs`` lists holding one ``[n_new_positions * n_layers, top_n]`` tensor
        per spec, position-major, covering positions ``first_position`` onward.

        Positions are read out as the engine produces them, exactly as the capture stream hands
        rows over, so a consumer still emits token-by-token. ``token_ids`` is the generated ids so
        far; pairing them with positions is the caller's job, since generation runs ahead.
        ``skip_before`` drops leading positions unread for a caller replaying a prompt whose
        read-out it already holds.

        ``stream_reduce`` collapses a hyper-connection trunk's stream stack to the one ``d_model``
        vector the lens was fitted on -- ``points`` is ``resid_streams`` there, and its rows carry an
        extra axis the transport and the unembed have no place for. Required on such a trunk and
        refused on a conventional one, by :meth:`ResidualBasis.require_stream_reduction`, because a
        mismatch either way produces a believable shape rather than an error. Which reduction is
        correct is the lens's property, not the model's, so it has to be passed in.

        A yield may carry new ids and NO positions (``top_idx``/``top_probs`` present but with
        zero rows), which is what makes that pairing terminate. The engine outruns the read-out
        RPCs, so one call routinely takes the positions for several sampled tokens and every
        later call comes back empty; withholding those yields left the caller's last-known id
        list short of the positions it was already holding, and it dropped them -- a lens run
        asking for 5 tokens returned 3, and the count moved with how far the engine ran ahead.
