"""What the unified free functions share to serve either backend.

``run_with_cache``, ``generate_stream``, ``capture_residuals`` and the rest each keep their
eager body and gain a second arm that goes through :class:`~interp_engine.sync.SyncModel`. This
module holds the two things all of those arms need: coercing whatever the caller passed as
tokens into the shape each backend wants, and the capability table that decides what an arm
must refuse.

**The dispatch shape to copy** when adding a function here -- a two-line front door, so the
eager path stays exactly what it was and the branch is visible at the top rather than threaded
through the body:

    def thing(model: InterpModel, tokens: TokensLike, ...) -> Result:
        if not isinstance(model, EagerModel):
            return _thing_via_protocol(model, tokens, ...)
        return _thing_eager(model, tokens, ...)

Eager first in the sense that its body is untouched: ``engine_adapter.py`` calls
``run_with_cache`` rather than ``await model.capture`` specifically because eager can hand back
a tensor on the device the SAE encode is about to run on, where the protocol method must return
CPU tensors. Routing eager through the facade would quietly add a device round-trip to a serving
path, so it does not.

# One signature over two backends creates exactly one new failure mode, and it is the dangerous
# kind: an argument that means something on one backend and nothing on the other returns a
# plausible, *unaffected* result with nothing anywhere to say so. That is the same shape of bug
# as a steering hook that never fires under CUDA graph replay, which is what `hooks_available`
# exists to prevent.
#
# So: every argument the chosen backend cannot honor raises, before any work is done, naming the
# capability and what to do instead. Not a warning, not a no-op, not a best-effort
# approximation. The messages are built from the table below rather than written at each call
# site, for the same reason `points.refusal_reasons()` is a table -- so the text cannot go stale
# in one arm while staying right in another, and so `tests/test_capability_refusals.py` can
# enumerate them.
