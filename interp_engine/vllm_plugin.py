"""Attach interp-engine capture and steering to a vLLM engine you built yourself.

:class:`VLLMModel` is the batteries-included option. This module is for the case where you
already have a ``vllm.LLM`` or ``AsyncLLM`` -- your own sampling parameters, your own serving
setup -- and want to read activations out of it without handing engine construction over.

    from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
    from interp_engine import Address, WORKER_EXTENSION_CLS, capture_engine_kwargs, decode_capture_payload

    llm = LLM(model="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B", worker_extension_cls=WORKER_EXTENSION_CLS,
              **capture_engine_kwargs())

    llm.collective_rpc("install_capture", args=(["resid_post.7"],))
    llm.generate(["The capital of France is"], SamplingParams(max_tokens=1))
    captured = decode_capture_payload(llm.collective_rpc("collect_capture")[0])
    resid = captured[Address("resid_post", 7)]   # [n_prompt_tokens, d_model], CPU

Points cross the wire as canonical address strings (``"resid_post.7"``, and
``"resid_post.7.stream-2"`` on a hyper-connection trunk); ``decode_capture_payload`` parses them
back into :class:`~interp_engine.address.Address` keys. The grammar has one definition, in
:mod:`interp_engine.address`, which both processes import.

Why an extension class rather than passing the functions directly: ``collective_rpc`` accepts
a callable, but on vLLM v1 the engine core runs in another process and the call is
msgpack-encoded, which refuses function objects unless ``VLLM_ALLOW_INSECURE_SERIALIZATION=1``
is set. Registering these as worker methods means they are invoked BY NAME, so nothing is
pickled and that flag is unnecessary.

vLLM refuses an extension whose attribute names collide with the worker's own, so the methods
here are named without the ``worker_`` prefix the module-level functions carry, and there are
no other public attributes on the class.

Two capture styles are exposed, and mixing them on one engine will confuse both:

- ``install_capture`` / ``collect_capture``: global hooks, one request in flight. Simplest,
  and what the example above uses.
- ``register_capture`` / ``collect_request``: per-request hooks keyed by vLLM request id,
  which is what makes concurrent capture possible. Requires passing a ``request_id`` to the
  engine yourself so the ids line up. :class:`VLLMModel` uses this style.

    """Engine kwargs that capture needs to be correct. Merge into your own constructor call.

    Both defaults are requirements rather than preferences:

    - ``enforce_eager=True`` because CUDA graphs skip Python forward hooks entirely, so
      capture returns nothing without it.
    - ``enable_prefix_caching=False`` because capture can only see tokens the worker actually
      forwards. On a prefix-cache hit vLLM serves the cached positions from the KV cache and
      schedules only the uncached suffix, so those positions never reach the hooks and the
      capture comes back SHORTER than the prompt, by an amount that depends on unrelated
      recent traffic. Only full blocks are cacheable, so this needs two prompts sharing a
      16-token prefix -- invisible in a quick script, routine on a real server.

    This is for callers who build their own engine and drive the worker functions by hand, which
    is why prefix caching goes off wholesale here. :class:`~interp_engine.vllm_backend.VLLMModel`
    does better and leaves it ON, because it controls every request it issues and can hand the
    intervening ones a ``cache_salt`` that isolates them (see ``VLLMModel._prompt``). Without that
    per-request control there is nothing to salt, so the engine-wide switch is the only safe answer.

    capture serves every point including ``resid_post``, so prefer it -- this is here because
