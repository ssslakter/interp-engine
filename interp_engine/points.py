"""The canonical hook points, as data: one row per point, and the properties consumers derive.

Everything that needs to know something about a point reads it from this table: the resolver, both
mappers, the vLLM client and worker, the reshape in :mod:`interp_engine.capture`, the protocol
docstring, the comparison spec, and the doc tables with their footnote markers. One table rather than
a description per consumer, because a point missing from any single consumer fails *silently* -- one
absent from ``HOOK_CAPTURE_POINTS`` is merely refused under vLLM, one absent from the width guard is
merely unchecked, one absent from the reshape set merely comes back with its batch and sequence axes
flattened together. A row here is what makes a point either fully added or plainly absent.

**What belongs here: properties of a point that hold across architectures.** Where the tensor comes
from does *not* -- that stays in :meth:`interp_engine.model.EagerModel.resolve_point`, because a
resolution is a module plus a side plus, for several points, a refusal that has to explain itself
(a parallel block has no ``resid_mid``; a sparse layer has no neuron basis; a fused ``gate_up_proj``
has no separable branches). Flattening those into a table would either lose the explanations or
grow a callable column per row, which is an if-chain with extra steps. So the table declares *what
each point is*, the resolver decides *where it is*, and :func:`known_names` is what lets a test
assert the two agree.

**What deliberately does not belong here: other frameworks' names.** ``mappers.py`` imports this
module's point set and is tested for coverage against it; the dependency runs that way and not the
other, so the engine never carries a vocabulary it does not own. See ``AGENTS.md``.

The set of points stays **open** -- an unrecognized name with no layer falls through to a dotted
module path, which is how a consumer taps something the core does not enumerate. This table is the
closed set of names with *declared semantics*, not a whitelist of what may be captured.

# --- the rows a hyper-connection trunk adds -----------------------------------------------------
#
# Points that exist only where the trunk carries several residual streams, in the same dataclass as
# the global rows so every consumer keeps reading one table.
#
# The bar for a conditional row is high, and manifold-constrained hyper-connections (mHC) are the
# case that clears it: the quantities below are not variations on a shared point (that is what the
# ``stream`` coordinate is for) but tensors with no counterpart on a conventional trunk at all -- a
# per-token collapse of several streams into one, and the doubly-stochastic matrix that remixes them
# afterwards. Giving them global names would put seven rows in front of every reader of every other
# family, and giving them none would leave the tensor that a steering vector or an SAE actually wants
# reachable only by dotted module path.
#
# Gated on the trunk a model was found to have and deliberately NOT on its architecture name, which
# for this trunk carries no information: `MotifForCausalLM` is Motif 2.6B, Motif 2-12.7B and Motif 3
# alike, and only the last has hyper-connections. A name-keyed table would offer these rows on the
# two that do not and refuse them at resolution time, one layer too late to be honest, while a
# checkpoint that switches the trunk off (`mhc_enabled=false`) would be mis-answered either way.
# :func:`interp_engine.facts.residual_streams` is where the count comes from; the module layouts each
# family puts these tensors in are :data:`interp_engine.facts.HYPER_CONNECTION_LAYOUTS`.
#
# A conditional name may not shadow a global one (checked below): one name, one meaning, everywhere.

#: What the two collapse rows share: the sublayer's argument is the collapse *after* the block's norm,
#: so it is `attn_in`/`mlp_in` and not this point, and the point is rebuilt rather than read. Quoted by
#: both, because a reader who takes the argument for the collapse gets a correctly-shaped tensor one
#: norm away -- and `facts.HyperConnectionLayout` already warns that this is the one place where being
#: approximately right is indistinguishable from being right.
_COLLAPSE_FUSED_NORM = (
    "the obvious address for it is WRONG on vllm's NVIDIA tree. The argument passed to the sublayer "
    "is not this tensor: attn_norm/ffn_norm are fused INTO the mHC pre kernel (nvidia/model.py passes "
    "norm_weight to mhc_pre_broadcast / mhc_fused_post_pre and its own comment says the norm is fused "
    "there), so that argument is the collapse already normed -- the engine's attn_in/mlp_in. Measured "
    "on DeepSeek-V4-Flash at layers 0/21/42: it matches RMSNorm(eager collapse) * norm.weight to 5e-3 "
    "and differs from eager's collapse itself by up to 24x, and the norm dropped a per-token scalar, "
    "so it cannot be inverted back. So this point is rebuilt from the stream stack the kernel was "
    "handed and the layer's flat hc_{site}_{fn,base,scale} -- the collapse half of vllm's own "
    "mhc_pre_torch, re-derived to 5e-3 against transformers' module. It is the one mHC row whose "
    "value is arithmetic rather than a tensor the engine computed. On the amd/ and xpu/ trees none of "
    "that is needed: they instantiate MHCPreOp/MHCFusedPostPreOp (CustomOp, so nn.Module) and apply "
    "attn_norm as a SEPARATE call afterwards, so there the unnormed collapse is a module output. "
    "Steerable, and for the same reason by an unobvious route: since the recompute agrees with the "
    "kernel only to 5e-3, the edit is applied as the DIFFERENCE it makes to the fused norm, "
    "norm(c + delta) - norm(c), which is exactly zero when delta is -- substituting norm(c + delta) "
    "outright would impose that 5e-3 on an unsteered request's sublayer"
)

#: What the four write/mix rows share, and the one property of the mixing matrix that the loose
#: version of gets wrong on the real checkpoint.
_SINKHORN_AXIS = (
    "the mixing matrix is COLUMN stochastic to 1e-6 and only roughly row stochastic (up to 7e-2 at "
    "hidden_size 4096). Sinkhorn ends on a column normalization, and the columns are also the axis "
    "the post phase contracts, so that is both the exact one and the meaningful one; the row error "
    "shrinks with more iterations and grows with width, so a fixture narrow enough to run cheaply "
    "will not show it"
)

#: The mHC rows -- every one eager-served on both families that have the trunk, and every one now
#: served under vLLM too. The notes below are about vLLM's DeepSeek-V4, which is the only mHC
#: implementation upstream vLLM has at all -- Motif 3 is served through its authors' fork, so on this
#: backend the question does not arise for it yet.
#:
#: The notes state what was MEASURED, on deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash under vLLM 0.26.0 on one B200
#: with enforce_eager, at layers 0/21/42 of 43 (`plans/scripts/verify_dsv4_mhc_vllm.py`), and against
#: transformers' own `DeepseekV4HyperConnection` on the same checkpoint's weights
#: (`plans/scripts/compare_dsv4_mhc_eager.py`).
#:
#: One fact of vllm's implementation shapes all seven rows, and it is worth stating once here:
#: **each sublayer's post phase is deferred into the next sublayer's pre phase kernel.** So within a
#: layer's forward the attention coefficients are computed and then overwritten, and the stream stack
#: that crosses the layer boundary is the one the MLP read rather than the one the block produced.
#: Only the MLP's pair survives to a module boundary; the other five are locals, and are served by
#: wrapping the kernel calls themselves (`vllm_capture.mhc`, and `vllm_capture._tree` for which
#: mechanism serves which row). That is a real distinction and not an implementation detail to
#: paper over: a wrapped kernel is NVIDIA-tree-specific, where a module hook would not be.
