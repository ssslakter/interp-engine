"""InterpEngine: standalone raw-transformers interpretability core.

Runs the plain HuggingFace model in eager PyTorch and captures/steers via our own
forward-hook layer. Eager (unfused) execution is what lets us read per-head attention
patterns, tap arbitrary hook points, and match reference numerics; serving is forward-only.
Keyed by the raw HuggingFace model id.
