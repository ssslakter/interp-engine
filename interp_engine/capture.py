"""Capture: run the raw model and collect activations at canonical hook points.

Replaces both TransformerLens ``run_with_cache`` and nnsight ``model.trace()/save()``.

Design invariants (protect future probing/monitoring apps):

- **Raw and SAE-agnostic.** Capture returns raw activation tensors for all positions. SAE
  ``.encode()`` and any reduction (max/mean/argmax) are caller-side.
- **Open set of hook points.** Any name :meth:`EagerModel.resolve_point` understands (plus
  ad-hoc dotted module paths) can be captured; the core needn't be edited to tap new points.
- Attention probabilities are not a module output, so they are captured via
  ``output_attentions=True`` (requires eager attention) rather than a forward hook. Pre-softmax
  scores are not even that; see :mod:`interp_engine.attn_scores`.
