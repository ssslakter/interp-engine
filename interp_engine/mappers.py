"""Translate TransformerLens and nnsight/nnterp hook names to canonical points, and back.

Two libraries name the same tensors differently from us, and porting code between them is mostly
renaming. This module is the one place that renaming lives, so a caller moving off
``HookedTransformer`` or ``StandardizedTransformer`` does not have to learn our vocabulary.

**The TransformerLens mapper is model-aware, and that is not incidental.** TransformerLens'
block-level ``hook_mlp_out`` fires *after* the post-sublayer norm on a sandwich-norm architecture,
so on Gemma-2/3/4 and OLMo-2/3 it is the residual contribution -- our ``mlp_out_post`` -- while
elsewhere it is the raw module output. Pure string translation would therefore hand a porting user
a tensor TransformerLens never gave them, with a cosine of ~0.2-0.4 against the real thing and no
error. Hence ``tlens_hook_to_point(hook_name, model)``.

TransformerLens also has a *separate* name for the raw output, ``blocks.{i}.mlp.hook_out``, which
maps to ``mlp_out`` on every architecture. Conflating the two is the mistake this module exists to
stop making; see :data:`_TLENS_BLOCK_LEVEL_NOTE`.

There are **two** such axes, not one. The second is the stream count: TransformerLens 3's
``BlockBridge`` aliases ``hook_resid_post`` onto ``hook_out``, but its DeepSeek-V4 bridge clears
that alias and declares ``hook_out_is_single_residual_stream = False``, so the same name is the
``(batch, pos, hc_mult, d_model)`` stack on a hyper-connection trunk -- our ``resid_streams``. Same
failure mode, a real tensor one concept over, and the same remedy: pass the model. The seven mHC
points otherwise map by name, because TransformerLens 3 registers a bridge per hyper-connection
module (``attn_hc``/``mlp_hc``) that hooks each of its three outputs separately.

The nnsight mapper is deliberately **not** model-aware: ``mlps_output`` is
``LayerAccessor(self, "mlp", IOType.OUTPUT)``, the raw module output, and neither nnsight nor nnterp
has any sandwich-norm awareness. Our ``mlp_out`` matches it exactly.

    where TL fires them. Without ``model`` they resolve to the raw points, which is pure string
    translation and differs on Gemma-2/3/4 and OLMo-2/3.

    ``mlp.hook_out``/``attn.hook_out`` always give the raw points, on any architecture.

    ``model`` decides a second question: the block-level ``hook_out`` is ``resid_post`` on a
    conventional trunk and ``resid_streams`` on a hyper-connection one, because TransformerLens 3's
    DeepSeek-V4 bridge drops the ``hook_resid_post`` alias and returns the stream stack from that
    hook instead. Without ``model`` it resolves to ``resid_post``, the reading that is right almost
    everywhere -- and wrong by a rank on DeepSeek-V4 and Motif 3.

    The two mHC hooks that carry a stream stack *in* are refused rather than mapped, with the reason:
    ``attn_hc.hook_in`` is the previous block's ``resid_streams`` and ``mlp_hc.hook_in`` is the
    mid-block stack, which is ``resid_mid`` in stream form and not ``resid_streams`` despite sharing
    its shape. The mHC hooks that come *out* -- ``hook_post``, ``hook_comb``, ``hook_out`` at both
    the ``attn_hc`` and ``mlp_hc`` sites -- all map, and need no ``model``.

    ``ln1.hook_normalized``/``ln2.hook_normalized`` are unmapped for a reason worth stating, because
    they look like the sublayer inputs: TransformerLens fires them on ``x / scale``, before the norm's
    gain, so they are neither the norm's input (``resid_pre``/``resid_mid``) nor its output
    (``attn_in``/``mlp_in``). Recompute rather than substitute -- dividing the captured input by
    ``scale`` from :func:`interp_engine.capture.rms_norm_parts` is TransformerLens' own arithmetic,
    and agrees with its hook to 2e-3 relative on gemma-2 (the residue is the converted weights'
    own drift, not the formula). Gemma Scope's transcoders are trained there, so this is a live
    distinction, not a pedantic one.

    Two QK-norm hooks are intentionally unmapped rather than approximated. ``q_norm.hook_scale`` is
    the norm's own denominator, an intermediate of its arithmetic that no hook on the module can
    return -- recompute it from ``q_norm_in`` and ``facts.rms_norm_eps``, which reproduces TL's
    definition exactly.     ``q_norm.hook_normalized`` fires between the divide and the weight multiply,
    so it is neither ``q_norm_in`` nor ``q_norm_out``; the bridge's ``q_norm.hook_out`` is the one
    that matches. Same for ``k_norm``.

    ``mlp.hook_expert_weights`` is unmapped for the same reason. TransformerLens fires it on the
    softmax over *all* experts, before the top-k -- so it is ``[..., n_experts]`` of probabilities,
    while our ``expert_weights`` is the ``[..., experts_per_token]`` the router actually applied,
    renormalized where the family renormalizes. Recover TL's tensor as
    ``softmax(cache["router_logits", layer])``, which is exact for the softmax-routed families and
    is *not* what gpt-oss or DeepSeek-V3 compute.

    as their SAELens ``hook_name``, circuit-tracer's as their ``feature_input_hook``, and OpenMOSS'
    Llama-Scope-2 Lorsa reads ``ln1`` where its transcoders read ``ln2``.
