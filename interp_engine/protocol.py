"""The surface both backends share, so callers can hold a model without knowing which.

:class:`InterpModel` is what :func:`interp_engine.load_model` returns, and the contract
:class:`~interp_engine.model.EagerModel` and :class:`~interp_engine.vllm_backend.VLLMModel`
both satisfy. Code written against it runs unchanged on either.

Everything that touches the model is ``async``, including on the eager backend where the
work is synchronous underneath. The alternative -- a sync protocol with an async vLLM
escape hatch -- pushes the difference back onto every caller, which is the thing this is
here to remove. Eager's wrappers are thin (see :meth:`EagerModel.capture`), so a caller
with no event loop can drive them through ``asyncio.run`` or reach past the protocol to
the free functions (``run_with_cache``, ``steer``, ``generate_stream``), which stay sync
and are the better fit for notebook use.

``asyncio.run`` is eager-only advice. A vLLM model is bound to the loop that built its
engine, and ``asyncio.run`` closes its loop on the way out, so a second call would reach
an engine nothing is driving -- :func:`interp_engine._loop.refuse_foreign_loop` raises
there rather than letting it hang. The free functions and ``sync_model`` are loop-free on
both backends, and are what a sync caller should use when the backend is not known.

Deliberately NOT in the protocol:

- **Per-head points** (``value``, ``attn_probs``) and attention patterns. vLLM's paged
  attention kernel never materializes a probability matrix, so it needs the off-kernel
  recompute in ``capture_attention``, which does not exist eagerly (eager just reads the
  real softmax). Ask for these behind an ``isinstance`` check or a capability query.
- **Prompt embeddings** (``generate_from_embeds``), which requires the vLLM engine to have
  been built with ``enable_prompt_embeds``.
- **Weight and module access** (``hf_model``, ``resolve_point``, and gradients *through the
  forward*). vLLM owns its weights in a worker subprocess; anything reaching for a module is
  eager-only by nature. The gradient *verdict* is in the protocol (``grad_support``) even though
  the capability is not, so a caller can gate on fact rather than on backend name.

So a protocol-typed caller gets capture at the residual/MLP points, generation, and the
lens read-out -- which covers the serving paths -- and everything else stays an explicit
backend choice rather than a method that raises on one of them.
