"""``EagerModel``: a thin, autograd-capable wrapper over a raw HuggingFace CausalLM.

Loads the plain ``transformers`` model in standard eager PyTorch (op-by-op, autograd
intact) with ``no_processing`` semantics (no weight folding/centering — TransformerLens's
``from_pretrained_no_processing`` did the same). Because we run the real model and hook the
real submodules, every architecture gotcha (RoPE, RMSNorm offset, embed scaling, softcap,
masks) is applied for free inside ``forward()``.

The canonical identifier is the **raw HuggingFace repo id** (e.g. ``"openai-community/gpt2"``,
``"google/gemma-2-2b"``). There is no Neuronpedia/TransformerLens name aliasing here — the
caller passes the HF id directly.

Never imports from ``neuronpedia_inference``.
