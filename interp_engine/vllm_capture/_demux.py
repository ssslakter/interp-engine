# =============================================================================
# Per-request demultiplexing (N-way concurrent capture + steering)
# =============================================================================
#
# The single-request path above installs GLOBAL hooks and runs ONE forward under a
# request lock. To serve many requests concurrently (vLLM batches them into a single
# forward), the worker must attribute each row of the flattened ``[num_tokens, hidden]``
# batch to its originating request, and apply/collect per request.
#
# Row layout (verified against vLLM 0.25.1):
#   req_ids  = model_runner.input_batch.req_ids            # persistent-batch order
#   seq_lens = [scheduler_output.num_scheduled_tokens[r] for r in req_ids]
#   the flat tensor is those requests' tokens concatenated in that order, with
#   ``seq_lens[i]`` rows each (``np.repeat(arange[:num_reqs], num_scheduled_tokens)``).
# We patch the runner's input-preparation method to snapshot this ordering into
# ``demux.current_meta`` before each forward; the layer hooks read it to slice. Both GPU
# runners are supported and they differ in where the layout comes from and in whether
# req_ids order is the row order -- see _ensure_patched. Which runner a model gets is
# vLLM's decision (MoE architectures default to V1), so neither path is optional.
#
# Hooks are PERSISTENT and refcounted per ``(point, layer)`` location: installing/
# removing a hook happens inside a ``collective_rpc`` call, which the worker runs
# BETWEEN forwards (single-threaded engine step loop) -- never mid-forward -- so there
# is no hook-list mutation race. A newly added hook no-ops for requests that did not
# register it, so adding one while another request is in flight is safe. One combined
# hook per location applies STEERING first, then CAPTURE (so captured residuals reflect
# the intervention), matching the eager engine and the single-request path above.
#
# request_id threading: the client (VLLMModel) picks the vLLM ``request_id`` and
# registers capture/steering under that SAME id before calling ``engine.generate(...,
# request_id)``, so the id the worker sees in ``input_batch.req_ids`` matches the
# registration. Unregistered requests (e.g. warmup) are skipped.
#
# All per-request captures ACCUMULATE (concatenate each forward's rows): for a
# max_tokens=1 read that is just the prefill (robust to chunked prefill); for a
# generation it is prefill + each decode step = prompt + generated-1 rows.
