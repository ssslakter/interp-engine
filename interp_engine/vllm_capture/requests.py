"""Per-request capture and steering: the combined hooks and the ``worker_register_*`` surface.

The top layer of the package, and what :class:`VLLMModel` actually drives. Persistent
refcounted hooks attribute each row of vLLM's batched forward to its request, so N requests
capture and steer concurrently. One combined hook per location applies STEERING first, then
CAPTURE, so captured residuals reflect the intervention -- matching the eager engine and the
single-request path in :mod:`~interp_engine.vllm_capture.capture`.

This is the only module allowed to depend on both the feature modules and the demux state;
the arrangement is what keeps the lens read-out and the lens intervention from forming a
cycle around :mod:`~interp_engine.vllm_capture._demux`.

    its attention actually consumes -- the span is ``None`` and the only adjustment is the rank
