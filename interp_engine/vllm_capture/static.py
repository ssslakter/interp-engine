"""Static taps under CUDA graphs: preallocated ``copy_`` reads and live-read writes.

Installed at the end of ``Worker.load_model``, before vLLM captures graphs. A non-empty static
set forces vLLM's breakable path (``VLLM_USE_BREAKABLE_CUDAGRAPH=1``): graph replay stays,
torch.compile does not. Dynamo traces a parent ``add_`` onto the wrong inner width (GPT-2

    Answers for an unrecognized block kind too, not just a known-recurrent one. Upstream maintains
    breakable-graph correctness where it needs it: the shared softmax op carries an eager break, and
    each family vLLM auto-enables the flag for (DeepSeek-V4, Kimi-K3, Inkling, MiniMax-M3) breaks in
    its own model file, while the *shared* recurrent layers everyone else uses -- ``mamba_mixer``,
    ``mamba_mixer2``, ``short_conv``, ``linear_attention``, ``qwen_gdn_attention_core``,
    ``olmo_hybrid_gdn_full_forward`` -- carry none. So a new recurrent family arrives corrupt by
    default, and ``is_linear_attention_layer`` reports an unknown kind as *attention* so that such a
    family still loads. That default is right for indexing attention probabilities and wrong here, so
    an unclassified kind is pinned as well: the cost of pinning is a slower prefill, and the cost of
    not pinning is a wrong answer nothing warns about.

    Static needs graph replay with torch.compile off (:func:`apply_breakable_env`), and in that one
    configuration vLLM computes a linear-attention trunk's **prefill** wrongly. Measured on
    ``Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B`` (24 layers, 18 GatedDeltaNet to 6 softmax): greedy continuations come back
    as unrelated text, and every captured point is uncorrelated with the hooked column at every
    layer, layer 0 included, with plausible per-layer norms -- a whole wrong forward rather than a
    bad tap.

    None of that is ours. Plain ``vllm.LLM`` with ``VLLM_USE_BREAKABLE_CUDAGRAPH=1``, no static set
    and nothing of this package in the process, reproduces the same two continuations byte for byte;
    the same engine with torch.compile left on is correct; so is ``enforce_eager=True``. Of the graph
    modes, ``PIECEWISE`` is also wrong and ``FULL_DECODE_ONLY`` is correct, which places it in graph
    capture of the mixed prefill-decode path.

    Running prefill eagerly costs nothing that matters here: the static wraps are ordinary PyTorch
    (``add_eager``), so they still fire, capture reads a prefill anyway, and decode -- where replay is
    the throughput win -- keeps its graphs.
