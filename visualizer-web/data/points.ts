/**
 * The canonical point table, transcribed from `interp_engine/points.py`.
 *
 * Order is forward order, and it is load-bearing: the diagram lays points out
 * left to right in exactly this sequence. `scope`, `width`, `vllm` and
 * `vllmNote` mirror the `PointSpec` rows upstream; `role`, `description` and
 * the trait gating are this app's additions.
 *
 * The `vllm` column is transcribed from the engine's **main branch**, not from
 * the 1.0.1 wheel this repo pins and captures against. Sixteen points are
 * hookable there and refused by 1.0.1 — the QK-norm four, `embeddings`,
 * `attn_in`, `mlp_act`, `router_logits`, `final_norm`, and all seven
 * hyper-connection rows — and `attn_scores` became a recompute rather than a
 * refusal. So a card here can show a vLLM call that
 * raises on the released engine, and the two only converge when the engine
 * releases and the pin moves. Nothing checks this: the transcription is by
 * hand, and the version it describes is a fact about this comment.
