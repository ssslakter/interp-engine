/**
 * Every point against both backends, from `data/points.ts` — the same table the
 * diagram is drawn from, so the two cannot disagree about which backend serves
 * what.
 *
 * Two shapes of the one list, because the two places that make the
 * standardization claim have opposite budgets. The **Standardized** hover card
 * under the wordmark is 340px wide and as tall as the window allows, so there it
 * is a table that scrolls down. The tour's slide is 720px wide inside a dialog
 * that already scrolls vertically, and a second vertical scroll inside it is a
 * scrollbar beside a scrollbar — so there the same rows run down five columns
 * and scroll sideways instead.
 *
 * The eager column is a constant, and printed anyway: "eager captures all of
 * them" is exactly the claim, and a single vLLM column would leave the reader
 * guessing what a missing check meant.
 *
 * Two marks, though `data/points.ts` has three states. It separates a point vLLM
 * serves from its worker hooks from one it rebuilds off-kernel from captured
 * q/k, and the point's own card on the diagram says which and quotes the
 * engine's reason — but that is a fact about how the engine gets there, not about
 * whether you can have the tensor. The question these two ask is what the
 * backend serves, and a recompute is served. A third mark spends a legend entry
 * and an amber glyph putting an asterisk on a claim that does not have one.
